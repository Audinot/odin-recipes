Hi, I'm Audinot. This is my first project for TOP. All the colours used are
based on the Monokai palette. It's a simple project, but I'm proud of it.

NOTE: As this is the first project, it does not have a responsive design and is
purely for Google Chrome on desktop. That is part of the assignment.

### Achievements
- I satisfied all the assignment requirements: homepage + 3 recipes.
- I memorized the boilerplate HTML when writing this project.
- I memorized the Git workflow.
- I learned to write README files.
- I applied everything I learned from the TOP Foundations CSS lessons.
- I made sure you can visit everything easily. Each recipe links back to Home.
- My goal was to make the project a bit more sleek and unified looking, so I
based the fonts and colours on my terminal.

### Project to-do list
- [x] Finish assignment requirements
- [x] Apply CSS Foundations
- [x] Add a very simple nav bar
- [x] Apply CSS box model to centre content and give a polished look

*Project end date: 01.18.2022*
