    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      I cannot describe to you what this tastes like, because I refuse to eat it. 
      I mean, have you looked at this thing? It's salad, <em>inside</em> gelatin. 
      Have you ever seen <strong>healthy</strong> food suspended in sugar?
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 envelopes -- unflavoured gelatin</li>
      <li>1/2 cup -- sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp -- salt</li>
      <li>1 can -- apple juice</li>
      <li>1/2 cup -- lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 tbsp -- vinegar</li>
      <li>1 cup -- shredded carrot</li>
      <li>1 cup -- sliced celery</li>
      <li>1 cup -- finely shredded cabbage</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped green pepper</li>
      <li>1 can (4 oz) -- chopped pimento</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small saucepan or pot, combine <strong>gelatin, sugar, and salt.</strong> Mix well.</li>
      <li>Add <strong>a cup of water.</strong> Stir over low heat until sugar and gelatin are dissolved.</li>
      <li>Remove from heat. Stir in apple juice, lemon juice, vinegar, and 1/4 cup cold water.</li>
      <li>Pour into medium bowl. Refridgerate for 1 hour, until the mixture is the consistency of beaten egg white, or toddler snot.</li>
      <li>Add carrot, celery, cabbage, green pepper, and pimento. Stir well until combined.</li>
      <li>Turn mixture over into a decorative, 11/2-quart mold. Refridgerate 4 hours, or until firm.</li>
      <li>Unmold by running a small spatula around the edges to release; invert onto a serving plate. Place hot dishcloth over mold; shake gently to release. Repeat, if necessary. Lift off mold. refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Makes 8 horrific servings, as if you know at least 7 actual humans who would help you eat this.</p>
