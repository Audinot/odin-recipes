    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      On paper, this recipe <em>seems</em> normal. Everything is fine. It's just a salmon
      platter. It's stuffed with things that go with salmon. It's just that it's stuffed
      and roasted like a Thanksgiving turkey. That's a little weird. Then it's topped with
      hot hollandaise, which is, you know, not what I would do. It's also suggested that
      this salmon be served with <strong>"Whipped Fruit Gelatin,"</strong> which sounds an awful
      lot like <em>Upsetting Recipes'</em> own Perfection Salad, which, may I remind you,
      is disgusting.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 whole salmon</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>3 tbsp -- lemon juice</li>
      <li>3/4 cup -- shredded carrots</li>
      <li>1/2 cup -- shredded onion</li>
      <li>1/2 cup -- finely chopped celery</li>
      <li>3 cups -- cooked rice</li>
      <li>Lemon slices</li>
      <li>Hollandaise sauce (warm)</li>
      <li>Poison, for Kuzko</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325° F (163° C). Clean, wash, and dry fish. Season fish with salt, pepper, and lemon juice.</li>
      <li>Fill fish cavity with a mixture of rice, carrots, onion, and celery. If you're feeling adventurous, add several drops of the poison, the poison for Kuzko, Kuzko's poison.</li>
      <li>If you have any leftover stuffing, place it in its own lightly greased baking dish to be cooked alongside the fish.</li>
      <li>Top fish with lemon slices and wrap securely in aluminum foil. Place in a shallow roasting pan.</li>
      <li>Bake everything in the oven for 1.5 to 2 hours., or until fish flakes easily under a fork.</li>
      <li>Scrape off any dark skin and slip fish onto a serving platter.</li>
      <li>As in the photo above, obliterate the fish in hot Hollandiase sauce, then decorate with parsley, pimento, and lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Serves 6 to 8 of your worst enemies.</p>
